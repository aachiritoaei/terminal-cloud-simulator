TERMINAL CLOUD SIMULATOR
===================

About
-----

This terminal cloud simulator was one of my homeworks during my second year of study in Computer Science.

Implementation
--------------

The simulator uses a Java implementation, which had to meet some given requirements(thus, a class structure 
was forced to be implemented, which does not best matches future implementations and some of my ideas).

Description
-----------

To begin with, the simulator presents a virtual file hierarchy which can be accesed in the terminal.

The basic info required to use may be accessed typing 'man' in the terminal.

The cloud features 3 stations of a set size(10000), in which files can be stored.

NOTE: This is not a real cloud. Files are stored virtually.

Usage
-----

- Windows

Run executable from 'Windows EXE' folder.

- Linux

Run 'java -jar AAACloud.jar' in terminal.

- Eclipse IDE

Import project, then run.
